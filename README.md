# ðŸŽ‚ Birthday Bot

A Discord bot that lets users submit their birthdays (DD-MM format), keeps a monthly-sorted list, assigns a birthday role on their special day, and sends a birthday greeting message in the channel. Includes a `/refresh` command to update the birthday list embed manually.

## Features

- Users submit birthdays via `/birthday` slash command (modal input)
- Birthdays stored persistently in a JSON file (`birthdays.json`)
- Birthday list embed sorted by month, updated daily and on demand
- Automatically assigns a "Birthday" role on the userâ€™s birthday
- Sends a public birthday greeting message in the designated channel on the userâ€™s birthday
- Removes birthday role and deletes birthday message the next day
- `/refresh` command to manually refresh the birthday list embed
